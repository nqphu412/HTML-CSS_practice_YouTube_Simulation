# Youtube Simulation (HTML & CSS Practice)
This project is a Youtube UI simulayion that I learned and built to practice **HTML and CSS**
The design is inspired by an **older version of YouTube's layout**, focusing mainly on structure and styling.

# Layout overview
The page is divided into three main sections:
1. **Header**: Top bar with search and menu icons
2. **Navigator**: Left sidebar for navigation
3. **Video**: Main grid displaying video thumbnails

# Limitation
- No API integration (videos are static, not dynamic)
- No search functionality, search bar is only for display
- Number of videos is limited to 12
- Best displayed on **laptops or PCs**
- Phone display is not supported
- This is only for practice purpose, not a functional Youtube clone
