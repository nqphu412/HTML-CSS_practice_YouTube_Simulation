# YouTube Simulation (HTML & CSS Practice)

This project is a **static simulation of YouTubeâ€™s desktop interface**, built as part of my personal journey learning HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s inspired by an older version of YouTubeâ€™s layout and focuses on replicating its structure and stylingâ€”not its functionality.

## Layout Overview

The page is divided into three main sections:

1. **Header**  
   - Top navigation bar with a search field and menu icons

2. **Sidebar Navigation**  
   - Left-hand menu with links to common YouTube sections

3. **Video Grid**  
   - Main content area displaying 12 static video thumbnails

---

## Limitations

- No API integration â€” videos are hardcoded and non-interactive  
- Search bar is purely visual (no functionality)  
- Limited to 12 sample videos  
- Optimized for **laptop and desktop viewports**  
- Not responsive on mobile devices  
- Created solely for practice â€” not a working YouTube clone

---

## Purpose

This simulation was built to:
- Practice semantic HTML structure  
- Explore CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid)  
- Understand basic UI composition and spacing  
- Experiment with styling consistency and visual hierarchy

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

---

## Future Improvements

- Make layout responsive for mobile devices  
- Add hover effects and transitions  
- Implement basic interactivity with JavaScript  
- Explore dynamic content loading via YouTube API
